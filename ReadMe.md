# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

> Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using data analysis and machine learning.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **complete machine learning workflow** using the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The objective is to **predict whether a passenger survived** based on features such as age, sex, class, and family size.  

The notebook covers:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Performance comparison among models

## 🧠 Machine Learning Goal
To build and evaluate predictive models that classify passengers into:
- `1` → Survived  
- `0` → Did not survive

## ⚙️ How to Run the Notebook
1. **Set up your Python environment** with the following libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
